# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this repository is to create updates to the PlanMyTrip app. The update will consist of three new features: Retrieve weather data, create customer travel destinations map, and create a travel itinerary map. 

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data gathered, we use our API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

## Deliverable 2: Travel Destination Map
For the Travel Destination Map, we use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

## Deliverable 3: Travel Itinerary Map
The Travel Itinerary Map allows us to use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, we created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

## Results
The app allows users to easily and efficiently plan vacations. They are able to look at weather, distance, and booking arrangements to conclude their vacation plans.
